        <h2>CONTACT</h2>
        <p>After some consideration, Ellie declines the offer of being queen. Although she has gotten better mentally, She likes 
        where she is now and wants to live out the rest of her life where she is with her family. You catch up with what Ellie has 
        been up to the past 6 years since your first contact. She tells you that she has completely dropped her psychotic side and 
        started a family with Nate, not too long after you saw her for the first time. After meeting up with Ellie again, you go 
        back home and tell the kingdom that Ellie decided to not take the position of Queen and gave up her royal position. With 
        Ellie giving up her place on the throne, you become next in line.</p>
