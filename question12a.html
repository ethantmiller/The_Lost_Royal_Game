        <h1>THE LOST ROYAL</h1>
        <p>As you are talking to Ellie about how the city has rebuilt and sent you 
        on a task to go find Ellie. After telling the plans that the Kingdom has to 
        coronate her upon her arrival, you see that she is conflicted about it. Ellie 
        spends some time thinking about your question and is hesitant to give an answer.</p>
        <p>What do you do?</p>
