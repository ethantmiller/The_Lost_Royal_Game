        <p>After some consideration, Ellie consults her family and decides that she is ready to be coronated and goes back to the 
          city. She was crowned Queen of the country. She focused on reconstruction of the country and oversaw a signing of a 
          treaty of recognition after fending off foreign powers. With the Treaty signed, Ellie was able to put her entire focus 
          on the reconstruction of the country and building relationships with other countries and kingdoms. Under her rule, the 
          kingdom exceeded from where it was previously and became a global power. Ellie was seen as the kingdom's greatest royal. </p>
