        <p>After some consideration, Ellie consults her family and decides that she is ready to be coronated and goes back 
        to the city. She was crowned Queen of the country. She focused on reconstruction of the country and oversaw a signing 
        of a treaty of recognition after fending off foreign powers. With the Treaty signed, Ellie was able to put her entire 
        focus on the reconstruction of the country and building relationships with other countries and kingdoms. Under her rule, 
        the kingdom exceeded from where it was previously and became a global power. Ellie was seen as the kingdom&apos;s greatest royal.
