        <p>As you delved deeper into Ellie's encampment, Ellie sensed danger as she was unable to recognise you and shot you with 
          multiple arrows. You die immediately and fall to the ground, after killing you, Ellie investigates her kill and realizes 
          that it was one of her only remaining living relatives. She couldn't bear the fact that she had just murdered her cousin, 
          She quickly dug a grave for you and wrote an apology to you. She spent the rest of the day sulking and getting depressed. 
          For what she knew, you were the only living relative that she hand left. She thought back to all of the memories that you 
          two had together and felt like she couldn't live with herself anymore. She climbed up to the highest point in her 
          immediate area and jumped off.</p>
