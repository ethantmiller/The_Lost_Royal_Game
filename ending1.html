        <h2>YOU DIED</h2>
        <p>As you delved deeper into Ellie&apos;s encampment, Ellie sensed danger as she was unable to recognise you 
        and shot you with multiple arrows. You die immediately and fall to the ground, after killing you, Ellie 
        investigates her kill and realizes that it was one of her only remaining living relatives. She couldn&apos;t 
        bear the fact that she had just murdered her cousin, She quickly dug a grave for you and wrote an apology 
        to you. She spent the rest of the day sulking and getting depressed. For what she knew, you were the only 
        living relative that she hand left. She thought back to all of the memories that you two had together and 
        felt like she couldn&apos;t live with herself anymore. She climbed up to the highest point in her immediate area 
        and jumped off.</p>
