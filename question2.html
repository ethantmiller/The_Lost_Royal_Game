        <h1>THE LOST ROYAL</h1>
        <p>You Decide to go directly to Ellie-May&apos;s encampment. You follow the Fox River that you believe leads directly to her encampment. 
        After 3 hours of traveling you get to the base of her camp where you can see several buildings. You slowly enter and explore some of the 
        buildings.</p>
        <p>You hear some strange sounds as you approach. What do you do?</p>
