        <p>You are sent on a mission to find the lost royal, Ellie-May. After 7 years of reconstruction, the kingdom felt like it is time to 
        properly reinstate the royal family with the crowning of Ellie-May. Nobody has seen her since the Defence of 1529, although there has 
        been some rumors of Ellie sightings within the Western Mountains. Due to you being the Kingdomâ€™s main messenger, you have a rough idea 
        of where she could be living.
