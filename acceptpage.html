        <h2>Question</h2>
          <p>You are sent on a mission to find the lost royal, Ellie-May. After 7 years of reconstruction, the kingdom felt like 
          it is time to properly reinstate the royal family with the crowning of Ellie-May. Nobody has seen her since the Defence 
          of 1529, although there has been some rumors of Ellie sightings within the Western Mountains. Due to you being the 
          Kingdom's main messenger, you have a rough idea of where she could be living.</p>
