        <p>After listening to the stories that Nate has told you, you ultimately decide to not risk your life and 
        don&apos;t visit her. You know have confirmation of where exactly where she lives and her current mental state. 
        Nate tells you that she has gotten extremely psychotic cannibal and has murdered many people and has an 
        extensive organ and bone collection. Nate also mentions that she had massacred several colonial villages 
        that exist on the other side of the mountains and recently burnt it to the ground. She seems quite happy 
        with her current lifestyle and is enjoying herself. He has often seen her either nude or excessively 
        covered in blood. You go back to the main city and tell the kingdom that she isn&apos;t suited for the position of queen.
