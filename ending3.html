        <p>She respectfully declines your offer as she feels comfortable where she is now and gives up her royal position. She has 
          been enjoying the way that she has been living for the past 7 years. You ask her more about what she has done since the 
          attack on the city. Ellie goes into vast detail, describing various murderers and acts of arson and violence that she has 
          done. She also took you on a tour of where she lives, showing you her bone and organ collection as well as showing you 
          where she leaves dead bodies to rot and where she goes to butcher them. After visiting her place, you return home and 
          tell the kingdom that Ellie decided not to take the position of Queen. With Ellie giving up her place in the throne, you 
          are next in line and you take the spot of Queen.</p>
