        <p>She respectfully declines your offer as she feels comfortable where she is now and gives 
        up her royal position. She has been enjoying the way that she has been living for the past 7 
        years. You ask her more about what she has done since the attack on the city. Ellie goes into 
        vast detail, describing various murderers and acts of arson and violence that she has done. 
        She also took you on a tour of where she lives, showing you her bone and organ collection as 
        well as showing you where she leaves dead bodies to rot and where she goes to butcher them. 
        After visiting her place, you return home and tell the kingdom that Ellie decided not to take 
        the position of Queen. With Ellie giving up her place in the throne, you are next in line and 
        you take the spot.</p>
