        <p>After some consideration, Ellie decides to come home and become queen. It takes some time for her to drop her psychotic 
          tendencies. Once she had dropped her psychotic tendencies, Ellie ramps up the kingdom's rebuilding process and jump starts 
          the kingdom to its once former glory. As the kingdom was rebuilding, some battles broke out between foreign powers, each 
          of which was defending our homeland. With Ellie's background in the countries militia during the time of the city's 
          destruction, She focused on the militia and the defence of the country. Ellie also helped with the reconstruction of the 
          country but with the almost yearly battles, the kingdom never really got back to where it once was.</p>
