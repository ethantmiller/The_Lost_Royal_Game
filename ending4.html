        <p>After some consideration, Ellie decides to come home and become queen. It takes some time for her to drop her 
        psychotic tendencies. Once she had dropped her psychotic tendencies, Ellie ramps up the kingdom&apos;s rebuilding process 
        and jump starts the kingdom to its once former glory. As the kingdom was rebuilding, some battles broke out between 
        foreign powers, each of which was defending our homeland. With Ellie&apos;s background in the countries militia during the 
        time of the city&apos;s destruction, She focused on the militia and the defence of the country. Ellie also helped with the 
        reconstruction of the country but with the almost yearly battles, the kingdom never really got back to where it once was.</p>
