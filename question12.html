        <h1>THE LOST ROYAL</h1>
        <p>Ellie recognises you immediately and drops her bow and gives you a big 
        hug. She brought both you and Nate into her house. She opens up to you and 
        tells you everything that she has been up to for the past 7 years. The stories 
        seem extremely concerning and you have a tough decision to make.</p>
        <p>What do you do?</p>
