        <h1>THE LOST ROYAL</h1>
        <p>You return 6 years later to Ellie&apos;s encampment to see if she is ready 
        to become Queen. When you arrive, you see a couple young girls running around 
        the place. When you come up to the campfire, you see Ellie nursing a third with 
        Nate by her side. She invites you to come sit.</p>
        <p>What do you ask Ellie?</p>
