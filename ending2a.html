        <p>After listening to the stories that Nate has told you, you ultimately decide to risk your life and visit her. After 
          spending a couple minutes walking around her place, you decide to cut your losses and leave immediately. When you get 
          back, Nate tells you about his conversations with Ellie and mentions all of the psychotic things that she has done over 
          the past 7 years. You gather this intell and head back to the main city of the kingdom and tell them that she isn't 
          suited for the position of queen. </p>
