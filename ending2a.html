        <p>After listening to the stories that Nate has told you, you ultimately decide to risk your life 
        and visit her. After spending a couple minutes walking around her place, you decide to cut your 
        losses and leave immediately. When you get back, Nate tells you about his conversations with Ellie 
        and mentions all of the psychotic things that she has done over the past 7 years. You gather this 
        intel and head back to the main city of the kingdom and tell them that she isn&apos;t suited for 
        the position of queen.</p>
